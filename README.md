**Architecture Design Document: Enterprise Backend Using Spring Boot, MySQL, Elasticsearch, and Kafka**

---

## 1. Overview

This architecture outlines an enterprise-grade backend system built with the following stack:

* **Spring Boot** for API and service orchestration
* **MySQL** as the primary system of record (transactional database)
* **Elasticsearch (ES)** for fast, full-text search and analytics
* **Apache Kafka** for asynchronous, decoupled event streaming between components

The system supports real-time indexing, flexible search capabilities, and transactional integrity.

---

## 2. Components

### 2.1 Spring Boot Services

* Expose REST APIs for consumers
* Handle business logic, validation, authentication
* Read/write to MySQL
* Produce events to Kafka upon data changes (e.g. user created, purchase made)
* Consume events to update Elasticsearch

### 2.2 MySQL

* Core database for users, products, orders, etc.
* Enforced constraints
* Version-controlled schema (Liquibase)

### 2.3 Elasticsearch

* Stores denormalized, search-optimized documents
* Used for full-text queries, filtering, faceted search, aggregations
* Updated via Kafka consumers or a sync job
* Aliases used for zero-downtime index versioning

### 2.4 Kafka (Message Broker)

* Acts as the decoupling layer between MySQL and ES
* Allows event-driven updates and reprocessing
* Topics: `user-events`, `order-events`, `product-events`
* Events include entity payloads (e.g. full user or purchase document) or deltas

## 3. Data Flow

### 3.1 Write Path (e.g. Create Order)

1. Frontend sends `POST /orders` to Spring Boot API
2. Spring Boot validates and writes order to MySQL
3. Spring Boot produces `order-created` event to Kafka
4. Kafka consumer receives event
5. Consumer denormalizes and writes to ES index `orders_v2`

### 3.2 Read Path (Search)

1. Frontend sends `GET /search/orders?userId=123&query=laptop`
2. Spring Boot uses ElasticsearchRestTemplate or SearchRepository
3. Query `orders` alias in Elasticsearch
4. Return results to frontend

---

## 4. Index Versioning Strategy

* Use versioned indices (e.g., `orders_v1`, `orders_v2`)
* Use aliases (e.g., `orders`) for stable app integration
* For breaking mapping changes:

    1. Create new index with updated mapping
    2. Reindex from old index or from MySQL via Kafka replay
    3. Switch alias to point to the new index

---

## 5. Security & Access Control

* Spring Security for OAuth2/JWT auth
* Elasticsearch sits behind the backend (not publicly exposed)
* Kafka ACLs configured for producers and consumers
* TLS everywhere (REST, Kafka, DB connections)

---

## 6. Optional Enhancements

* Change Data Capture (CDC) from MySQL to Kafka via Debezium
* Index warming and rolling updates
* Caching layer for search results (e.g., Redis)
* GraphQL gateway over Spring Boot services
* add Monitoring system (Grafana, ELK, Loki)

---

## 7. Summary

This architecture ensures scalable, decoupled, and search-friendly enterprise backend services using proven open-source tools. By combining transactional MySQL storage with high-performance Elasticsearch and event-driven Kafka communication, the system can support complex read/write workloads with high availability and extensibility.

## 8. Testing the apis

```
GET http://localhost:8080/api/purchases
Accept: application/json


###

GET http://localhost:8080/api/user/2/purchases
Accept: application/json


###

POST http://localhost:8080/api/purchase?userId=2&bookId=2
Content-Type: application/json


###
```
